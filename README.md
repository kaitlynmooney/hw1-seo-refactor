# <Homework 1: SEO Refactor>

## Description
For this project, I modified to source code in order to meet the requirements. I added semantic HTML elements to replace the numerous non-semantic elements. I edited HTML and CSS elements to ensure they followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
I added accessible alt attributes to image elements and edited headings to follow a sequential order. Finally, I added a descriptive, concise title.
